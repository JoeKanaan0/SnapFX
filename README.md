# SnapFX

SnapFX is a Snapchat clone built with JavaFX and Springboot and uses OpenCV for face detection.

The desktop app allows users to log into their accounts and take photos using filters such as hats, mustaches, hair, beards... The user can then choose to save the photos and he can send the photos to his friends and talk to them similar to Snapchat.
